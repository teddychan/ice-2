/// App-owned "What's New" content for Ice 2, rendered by DragonKit's ``WhatsNewPane``.
///
/// Only the app's own content lives here — the layout is owned by DragonKit. The version is not
/// passed at all: ``WhatsNewContent`` reads `CFBundleShortVersionString` itself and renders it
/// through ``DragonVersion/display(_:)``, so it always matches About and the update checker and
/// carries the same single `v` prefix. Update the `date` and `sections` per release.
///
/// This pane once went four releases without an update — it still described 2.11.0 while 2.14.1
/// shipped — so 2.12.0 through 2.14.0 were never announced to anyone who reads the app rather
/// than the changelog, including the removal of item groups. 2.14.5 carried the cumulative
/// catch-up that paid that debt off, so these notes describe this release alone again.
/// `MAC-APP-RELEASE-LIFECYCLE.md` now makes updating this file part of every public release,
/// gated on the tag.
