/// Only Ice 2's own content lives here — the confirmation layout and the teardown are owned
/// by DragonKit. Ice 2's settings live in its `UserDefaults` domain (`Defaults.store` is
/// `.standard`), which the shared teardown wipes from `bundleID` along with the matching
/// preference plist and saved application state, so there are no extra suites. Ice 2 keeps no
/// separate user data either — its settings *are* its data, always removed — so there is no
/// optional "also delete data" toggle, unlike ClipMenu.
///
/// `extraCleanupPaths` covers the per-bundle-id folders the shared teardown can't know about:
/// the `Caches` and `HTTPStorages` folders macOS creates for the app's own network traffic
/// (Sparkle's appcast fetches), plus `Application Support`. Ice 2 writes nothing to
/// `Application Support` today, but it is listed so the in-app uninstall, the manual `rm -rf`
/// in `README.md`, and the Homebrew cask's `zap trash:` all remove the same five paths —
/// keeping those three from drifting is the point, and removing an absent folder is a no-op.

    /// teddychan/homebrew-tap, not inferred from the repo name. Homebrew never watches the
    /// filesystem, so an app that deletes itself leaves brew's receipt still claiming the cask is
    /// installed and `Caskroom/ice-2/<version>/Ice 2.app` a dangling symlink; `brew install --cask
    /// ice-2` then refuses outright — "already installed" — for an app that isn't there, pointing
    /// at nothing that would fix it. Naming the token lets the kit's post-exit shell run
    /// `brew uninstall --cask --force ice-2` and clear that record.

    /// The comparison is the kit's (``UninstallConfig/caskToken(_:ifBundleIs:actual:)``, DragonKit
    /// 3.2.0) rather than a local `==`, because it has to fail closed and Ice 2's own version
    /// didn't. `brew uninstall --cask` is not bundle-scoped: it deletes whatever the receipt points
    /// at — the *release* app in /Applications — and the cask carries `uninstall quit:`, so it
    /// quits that app first. A debug build (com.dragonapp.ice.debug), which brew never installed,
    /// must issue nothing; so must a build that can't state its id at all. Ice 2 used to compare
    /// `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? releaseBundleID`, so a missing id fell back to the release
    /// id and handed the delete to the one build least entitled to it. Hence the raw identifier
    /// here, never `config`'s fallen-back `bundleID`.
