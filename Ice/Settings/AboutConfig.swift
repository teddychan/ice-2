            // One holder, not two. This row used to read `© 2025 Jordan Baird · © 2026 Teddy
            // Chan`; only Ice 2 and clipmenu-2 did that, and DragonKit 4.0.0 made the
            // single-holder form canon (CONFORMANCE §R14) after five About panes were put side by
            // side. The row names who maintains and distributes *this* app. Ice 2's lineage is
            // not dropped by saying so — it is carried by the `Original project` link and the
            // `Based on` credit below, both driven by `OriginalWork`.
            //
            // `NSHumanReadableCopyright` now matches this string exactly. It carried both holders
            // until 2.14.7, on the reasoning that Ice 2 is a git fork of Jordan Baird's Ice rather
            // than a clean reimplementation, that GPL-3.0 §4 requires his notice to travel with the
            // binary, and that the plist key IS the binary's notice.
            //
            // The first two clauses are true and unchanged. The third was the mistake: that key is
            // an OPTIONAL Apple key, named by no licence, and three of the five Dragon apps shipped
            // without it at all. §4's "conspicuously and appropriately publish an appropriate
            // copyright notice" is carried by `LICENSE`, which fills in the GPL's own template with
            // his name and year, and by `Resources/Acknowledgements.rtf`, which states in as many
            // words that Ice 2 inherits GPL-3.0 from the original Ice. Neither moves here. What the
            // plist key does is display a line in Finder's Get Info panel, which makes it
            // presentation — the same thing this row is — so the two disagreeing was drift, not
            // compliance.
            //
            // Both are now the app's own holder, and the lineage sits where the pane puts it:
            // ``OriginalWork`` drives the `Original project` link and the `Based on` credit, and
            // the licence texts are bundled and published at dragonapp.com/ice-2/licenses/.
