#
# run-debug.sh — build Ice and (re)launch the Debug product as "Ice 2 Debug".
#
# Why: a debug build must not share the installed app's bundle id
# (com.dragonapp.ice), which collides on TCC permissions, the menu-bar manager,
# and the UserDefaults domain. The Debug configuration handles that itself: it
# sets PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER to com.dragonapp.ice.debug and the display name
# to "Ice 2 Debug", so the built product is already the isolated app and
# `xcodebuild test` gets the same isolation without going through this script.
#
# This script therefore builds, stamps and launches — it deliberately does NOT
# copy the product to a second bundle. An earlier version did, which left two
# bundles claiming com.dragonapp.ice.debug in every DerivedData folder;
# LaunchServices then resolved that id ambiguously and could launch a stale build
# instead of the one just built. One bundle per checkout, one id.
#
# PRODUCT_NAME is "Ice 2 Debug" in the Debug configuration, so the bundle on disk,
# its executable, CFBundleName and CFBundleDisplayName all read "Ice 2 Debug" —
# there is nowhere left for the name "Ice 2" to appear on a debug build.
# PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME is pinned to Ice_2 so the Swift module keeps the name
# IceTests imports; TEST_HOST points at the Debug product by its own name.
#
# What the script stamps afterwards (all of them need the built bundle to exist):
#   CFBundleVersion             the git commit count, never a hardcoded number
#   DragonCommitDate            the commit's own timestamp
#   DragonBuildChannel          "Debug", which DragonKit renders as "vX.Y.Z Debug (<build>)"
#   SUEnableAutomaticChecks     false, so a debug build never schedules a production check
# and what it deletes:
#   SUFeedURL                   so the production appcast is unreachable from this bundle
#
# CFBundleShortVersionString is asserted to be numeric X.Y.Z and is never modified. It used to
# be suffixed " (Debug)" here; MAC-APP-RELEASE-LIFECYCLE.md forbids that outright, because that
# field is the sole source of truth for the version the public `vX.Y.Z` tag is checked against,
# and a debug build is the *same* numeric candidate as the next release — "Debug" is a channel
# label, never part of a version number. DragonKit 3.3.0's DragonAbout.buildChannel(_:) reads
# DragonBuildChannel and renders the label beside the version instead.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/run-debug.sh
#
# This is the Ice-specific instance of a shared convention: every Dragon macOS
# app builds its debug product as "<App> Debug" (<release-bundle-id>.debug).
# Other repos can copy this and change the vars below. See the "dragon-mac-ops"
# skill for the general recipe + rationale.
