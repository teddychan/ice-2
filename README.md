    <p><strong>Menu bar management for macOS</strong></p>
</div>

Ice 2 hides and shows the items in your macOS menu bar. It splits the menu bar into
visible, hidden, and always-hidden sections that you reveal by click, hover, scroll,
or hotkey. Beyond hiding items, it customizes the menu bar's appearance, saves layout
profiles, and searches your items.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later.
- An Apple Silicon Mac. Ice 2 is built for arm64 only; if you are on an Intel Mac,
  stay on version 2.4.1, which remains available on the
  [releases page](https://github.com/teddychan/ice-2/releases).
- Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions. Ice 2 asks for both on first
  launch and cannot manage menu bar items without them.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install --cask teddychan/tap/ice-2
```

### Manual

Download the `Ice-2-vX.Y.Z.zip` file from the
[latest release](https://github.com/teddychan/ice-2/releases/latest) and move the
unzipped app into your `Applications` folder.

### Uninstall

Quit Ice 2 before uninstalling.

If you installed with Homebrew:

```sh
brew uninstall --cask teddychan/tap/ice-2
```

If you installed manually, delete `Ice 2.app` from your `Applications` folder.

To also remove Ice 2 settings and cached data:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.dragonapp.ice \
       ~/Library/Caches/com.dragonapp.ice \
       ~/Library/HTTPStorages/com.dragonapp.ice \
       ~/Library/Preferences/com.dragonapp.ice.plist \
       ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.dragonapp.ice.savedState
```

## Menu bar sections

Ice 2 divides the menu bar into three sections — **Visible**, **Hidden**, and
**Always-Hidden** — and installs one control item per enabled section as a divider
between them. macOS adds new items to the left end of the menu bar, which is where
the always-hidden section lives.

- **Click** Ice 2's icon to toggle its section.
- **Option-click** it to toggle the always-hidden section.
- **Control-click** it to open Ice 2's menu. Turn this off under
  **Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ Other**.
- **Command-drag** an item along the menu bar to move it into another section.

The always-hidden section is enabled by default. Turn it off, or change how the
dividers look, under **Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ Menu Bar Sections**.

## Troubleshooting

Common problems and their fixes are collected in
[FREQUENT_ISSUES.md](FREQUENT_ISSUES.md) — items landing in the always-hidden
section, items that appear to have been removed, item order not being remembered,
and the `Ice 2 cannot arrange menu bar items in automatically hidden menu bars`
error.

If Ice 2 cannot see or move your menu bar items, check that it still has
Accessibility and Screen Recording permission in **System Settings ▸ Privacy &
Security**. Granting Screen Recording may require relaunching Ice 2.

### Why does Ice 2 require macOS 26 and later?

Ice 2 uses a number of system APIs that are available starting in macOS 26, and it
builds against the macOS 26 SDK. As such, there are no plans to support earlier
versions of macOS. Older releases remain downloadable on the
[releases page](https://github.com/teddychan/ice-2/releases).

### Can I back up, restore, or sync my settings?

Yes. Open **Settings ▸ Backup & Restore** and choose a backup folder. Use **Back Up Now** to save a snapshot of all your Ice 2 settings (layout profiles, spacers, triggers, hotkeys, and appearance), and Ice 2 also backs up automatically when you quit. The newest 10 backups are kept; you can restore any of them with one click (Ice 2 relaunches to apply).

To **sync across Macs** or move to a new Mac, point the backup folder at a synced location such as Dropbox, iCloud Drive, or Google Drive — your settings then appear on your other Macs, where you can restore them.

## Building from source

Ice 2 is a plain Xcode project — no package manager step is required.

1. Clone the repo and open `Ice.xcodeproj` in Xcode 26 or later (the project targets
   the macOS 26 SDK and builds for arm64).
2. Select the **Ice** scheme and run. The product is named `Ice 2.app`.

From the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -scheme Ice -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -scheme Ice -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

The **Ice** scheme's test action runs the `IceTests` unit-test target.

The Debug configuration builds the app as `com.dragonapp.ice.debug`, displayed as
**Ice 2 Debug**, never the release id — so neither a local build nor the test host
(which runs *inside* the app) can read or write the settings of an installed Ice 2.
The product itself is the isolated app; nothing re-ids it afterwards, so only one
bundle ever claims that id.

To try a local build alongside an installed copy of Ice 2, use the debug runner. It
builds the **Ice** scheme and launches the product, which already has its own name,
permissions, and settings, alongside the release app:

```sh
bash scripts/run-debug.sh
```

Swift sources are linted with [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
(`.swiftlint.yml`); CI runs `swiftlint lint --strict` on every pull request that
touches Swift files.

## Tests

The unit tests live in `IceTests/` and are written with Swift Testing. They cover the
pure, permission-free parts of Ice 2: menu bar item tags and layout profiles, section
names and triggers, appearance configuration and its settings upgrades, colors and
gradients, hotkeys (key codes, modifiers, combinations, and actions), menu bar image
processing and window identification, code signing checks, settings persistence and
backup, and the shared concurrency helpers. Anything that needs live `NSStatusItem`s,
event taps, or granted permissions is covered by the manual checklist in
[docs/testing/layout-pane-manual-tests.md](docs/testing/layout-pane-manual-tests.md)
instead. CI runs the suite on every pull request; the Debug configuration signs ad-hoc,
so no Apple Development certificate is needed to run it locally either.

[![Tests](https://github.com/teddychan/ice-2/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/teddychan/ice-2/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Ice.xcodeproj -scheme Ice \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64'
```

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Test cases | 261 passing |
| Line coverage | 14.3% of the `Ice 2.app` target |
| Measured on | v2.9.10 (`f55a610`), Xcode 26.6 on macOS 26.5.2 |

Coverage is low by nature rather than by neglect: most of the app target is SwiftUI
settings views and menu-bar machinery that needs live status items, event taps, and
granted permissions, none of which run headlessly. The tests concentrate on the logic
that can be exercised without them.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

- Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before taking part.
- Check [FREQUENT_ISSUES.md](FREQUENT_ISSUES.md) first — several common reports are
  already answered there.
- Keep the build lint-clean; CI runs SwiftLint in strict mode.
- Release mechanics (tagging, signing, notarization, the Sparkle appcast, and the
  Homebrew cask) are documented in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
